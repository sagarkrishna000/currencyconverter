# React + Vite

This is a currency converter application, which provides for the easy conversion of currency values based on present-day exchange rates. It can quickly convert the value of one currency to another, such as dollars to euros, or euros to pounds, and back again.
It is built using React and Tailwind, and fetches currency values from an API. It is a very basic application but gives a clear understanding of Hooks and States in React. Also it helps in learning the concept of fetching data from API's. It is built while learning a React from a course (credits - Hitesh Choudhary YT channel).
